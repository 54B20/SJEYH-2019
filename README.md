# SJEYH-2019
Hello!  This repository is for storing/publishing materials for attendees
of my workshop at the [2019 San Joaquin Expanding Your Horizons event](https://www.sjeyh.org/).
If you did not attend the workshop, you are still welcome to browse this 
repository, and take whatever you like (GPLv3, see License.txt).  However, 
I will only respond to issues and other correspondence from the workshop
attendees.


### About the Workshop
The workshop is a seventy-five minute in-class session consisting of a brief 
presentation, followed by a hands-on activity where groups will configure
microcontrollers to act as various inputs to a [simple] autonomous rover.
The hands-on activity will lead into a demonstration of the rover functioning
with the attached sensors, then a discussion of how such architectures
are ubiquitous today, and what challenges they bring.  Specifically, we will
discuss what can happen when sensors go bad 
(see [737MAX](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/a-lack-of-redundancies-on-737-max-system-has-baffled-even-those-who-worked-on-the-jet/)), 
when sensor data is interpreted incorrectly 
(see [Self-Driving Cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_self-driving_car_fatalities)), 
and how sensors can be a vector for attack 
(see [Fish Tank](https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/19/technology/fish-tank-hack-darktrace/index.html)). 
Lastly, we will discuss the concept of attack vectors/surfaces,
and how distributed systems can expose surprising  vulnerabilities (see [In Flight Entertainment](https://www.wired.com/2015/05/feds-say-banned-researcher-commandeered-plane/)).
